This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s curriculum. The project page can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-todo-list).

The goal of this project is to build a todo list web app, applying the object oriented programming principles learned in previous lessons.

I heavily referenced the design of [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/webapp)'s web app, but all of the code is my own.
